# Cheap Marketplace API
This is a challenge resolution requested by RatherLabs. 

## Endpoints
- [GET] /listings', '/listings/:address
- [GET] /offers
- [POST] /sell
- [POST] /bid
- [POST] /accept-offer (need env MARKETPLACE_PRIVATE_KEY)

## How to run it
```
git clone https://github.com/amilcarrey/cheap-marketplace.git
cd cheap-marketplace
pnpm i
pnpm start
```
In the root folder you will find a postman collection ready to import all the endpoints. Also there is a preconfigured parameter in /accept-offer. 

The signatures were generated by the script in signatureGenerator.ts. 

Inside the .env.template you will find three different environment variables. To be able to send the transaction you must configure at least MARKETPLACE_PRIVATE_KEY. The others variables are usefull to generate new parameters using signatureGenerator.ts.
